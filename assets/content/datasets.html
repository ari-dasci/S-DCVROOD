<p class="lead"> In this section you can find information about the datasets used in the experiments.</p>
<ul class="lead">
    <li><strong>CIFAR</strong>: The two CIFAR datasets consist of color images with a resolution of 32×32 pixels. The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. CIFAR100 has 100 classes containing 600 images each, 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR100 are grouped into 20 superclasses.</li>
    <li><strong>Tiny ImageNet</strong>: Tiny ImageNet is a downsized subset of the ImageNet dataset, consisting of color images with a resolution of 64x64 pixels. It includes 200 classes, each containing 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 test images, totaling 120000 images.</li>
    <li><strong>DTD</strong>: The Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) contains 5640 color images categorized into 47 describable texture attributes, such as <em>striped</em>, <em>rough</em>, or <em>woven</em>. Each class contains 120 images. The images vary in resolution and were collected under uncontrolled conditions, making the dataset suitable for studying texture recognition in the wild.</li>
    <li><strong>EMNIST</strong>: The EMNIST dataset is an extension of the original MNIST dataset, introducing several new partitions. In this work, we use only the Letters and MNIST splits. EMNIST Letters comprises 145600 training images and 14500 test images distributed across 26 classes, representing the uppercase letters of the English alphabet without case distinction. EMNIST MNIST replicates the original digit dataset, consisting of grayscale 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0–9), with 60000 training and 10000 test samples.</li>
    <li><strong>SUPERCIFAR-100</strong>: A dataset derived from CIFAR-100, organized in a hierarchical structure. It consists of 10 superclasses, each containing 10 subclasses. Unlike the original dataset, SuperCIFAR-100 is divided into two splits that do not share any classes at any level of the hierarchy. This division is made for experimental purposes, in order to define one split for in-distribution data and another for out-of-distribution data.</li>
