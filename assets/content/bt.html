<h1><i class="fa-solid fa-chart-line"></i> Benchmark Truth</h1>
<p class="lead"> This section presents the benchmark results obtained from 100 independent iterations of the convergence analysis. The reported values correspond to the mean performance of the evaluated OOD detection methods, both with and without Outlier Exposure (OE), across all metrics. These results serve as the reference benchmark for assessing the effectiveness of the proposed DCV-ROOD approach.</p>
