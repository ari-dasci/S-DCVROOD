<p class="lead"> This section presents the statistical analysis used to quantify the fidelity to the benchmark truth. A match is defined as a statistically significant difference between two methods that appears both in the DCV-ROOD experiments and in the benchmark truth. Non-parametric Mann–Whitney U tests were used for pairwise comparisons across CV experiments, except in cases where normality was verified, in which the Student’s t-test was applied.  </p>
