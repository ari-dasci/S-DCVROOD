<p class="lead"> This section reports the average number of correct detections in DCV-ROOD for method pairs that were significant in the benchmark truth. Values show the mean number of runs (out of 10) in which the same differences were observed, while the error rate reflects false detections for pairs not significant in the benchmark. These metrics indicate how well DCV-ROOD replicates the benchmark results. </p>
